    <h6>My Hobbies;</h6>

    <h2 class="hh2">Software Development</h2>
    <p class="hp">I started learning to code in the year 2022 which i got a job as a junor developer for <a href="https://github.com/">Github.</a> Writing codes is something i've always wanted to do since i wondered and realized how simple and complex websites were made The first time I actually looked at the code in a browser window was revelatory for me. Here was the internet in the internet‚Äôs own voice! I didn‚Äôt understand most of it, but I could pick out snippets of words and phrases that looked familiar. There were a few font names that I recognized, and I understood pixel sizes more or less. The rest of it was alien to me. Here was the language my computer spoke, or so I found interest in writing codes to deliver amazing websites for firms and any kind of organizations.
      Computer coding is the use of computer programming languages to give computers and machines a set of instructions on what actions to perform. Coding is how humans communicate with machines. It's what allows us to create computer software like programs, operating systems, and mobile applications. My learning begun with languages like HTML, CSS, Java...Coding became a part of me after my migration to the USA......</p>



      <h2 class="hh2">Presenting</h2>
      <p class="hp">Taking you back in time here and giving you a higher point on me, i attended a scsondary school in lagos,Nigria where i was selected as the head of girls to represent the girls in the whole school it was a good but though experience leading hundreds of girls. Everyone knows how women can be and how much they wont want to be corrected or controlled especially not by their mates. Maintaining this position, i have to write several speeches for each day to present im a public place and a breakdown for every teacher and student to get the information i'm passing clearly. This made me develop interest in presenting with a huge mindset of passing information. After my sesion in the school, i got admitted into one of the biggest universities in NIgeria. As times goes by in the school i got to meet with the presenter of the school FM station which my friend "lolade" made me celebrate as a major win lol after a tiral with the senior presenters and series of external presenters for the school, i got employed as a presenter and ever since then i made a big name in the school and media as a senior presenter anywhere üòÉ all thanks to Almighty ALLAH ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
      <h6>Here are some of my good works from the past few years as a presenter;</h6>
